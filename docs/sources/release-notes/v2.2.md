# Grafana Mimir version 2.2 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce version 2.2 of Grafana Mimir, the most scalable, most performant open source time series database in the world.

Highlights include the top features, enhancements, and bugfixes in this release. If you are upgrading from Grafana Mimir 2.1, there is migration-related information as well.
For the complete list of changes, see the [Changelog](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

- **Support for ingesting out-of-order samples**: Grafana Mimir includes new, experimental support for ingesting out-of-order samples.
  This support is configurable, with users able to set how far out-of-order Mimir will accept samples on a per-tenant basis.
  **TODO: Link to documentation after https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2183 is merged.**

- **Backfill API**: Grafana Mimir 2.2 includes the new backfill API. TODO: expand once mimirtool changes are in.

- **Error messages**: The error messages that Mimir reports are more human readable, and the messages include error codes that are easily searchable.
  For descriptions of errors, see the [Grafana Mimir runbooks / Codified errors]({{< relref "../operators-guide/mimir-runbooks/_index.md#codified-errors" >}}).

- **Configurable prefix for object storage**: Mimir can now store block data, rules, and alerts in one bucket, each under its own user-defined prefix, rather than requiring one bucket for each. You can configure the storage prefix by using `-<storage>.storage-prefix` option for corresponding storage: `ruler-storage`, `alertmanager-storage` or `blocks-storage`.

## Upgrade considerations

We have updated default values and some parameters in Grafana Mimir 2.2 to give you a better out-of-the-box experience:

- Message size limits for gRPC messages exchanged between internal Mimir components increased to 100 MiB from the previous 4 MiB. This helps to avoid internal server errors when pushing or querying large data.

- The `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.ignore-blocks-within` parameter changed from `0` to `10h`. The default value of `-querier.query-store-after` changed from `0` to `12h`. Both changes improve query-performance for most-recent data by querying only the ingesters, rather than object storage.

The option `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period` has been deprecated. If you previously changed this option from its default of `0s`, set `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-enabled` to `true` and specify the lookback period by setting the `-querier.query-ingesters-within` option.

- The `-memberlist.abort-if-join-fails` parameter now defaults to false. This means that when using memberlist and a component fails to join the memberlist cluster, it no longer aborts startup by default.

## Bug fixes

- [PR 1883](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/1883): Fixed a bug that caused the query-frontend and querier to crash when they received a user query with a special regular expression label matcher.
- [PR 1933](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/1933): Fixed a bug in the [ingester ring page]({{< relref "../operators-guide/reference-http-api/index.md#ingesters-ring-status" >}}), which showed incorrect status of entries in the ring.
- [PR 2090](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2090): Ruler in [remote rule evaluation mode]({{< relref "../operators-guide/architecture/components/ruler/index.md#remote" >}}) now applies the timeout correctly. Previously the ruler could get stuck forever, which halted rule evaluation.
